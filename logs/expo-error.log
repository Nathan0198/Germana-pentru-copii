The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@2.2.0 - expected version: 2.1.2
  lottie-react-native@7.3.2 - expected version: 7.2.2
  react-native-gesture-handler@2.28.0 - expected version: ~2.24.0
  react-native-reanimated@4.0.2 - expected version: ~3.17.4
  react-native-screens@4.14.1 - expected version: ~4.11.1
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
[Reanimated] Seems like you are using a Babel plugin `react-native-reanimated/plugin`. It was moved to `react-native-worklets` package. Please use `react-native-worklets/plugin` instead.
